      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        The <b>Alternate Reality Initiative (ARI)</b> is a student organization at the University of Michigan centered around virtual, augmented,
        and mixed-reality technology. After seeing a lack of a centralized community, we created ARI to provide a hub and community for 
        students interested in XR technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through weekly meetings, ARI is <b>fostering the next generation of XR innovators</b> by hosting development workshops,
        discussing industry news, and connecting students to opportunities in the greater XR ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded in January 2018, ARI has received recognition and generous support from other University of Michigan organizations. 
        In April 2018, ARI received a $5,000 optiMize project grant and was accepted into the competitive Barger Leadership Institute Capstone program.
        In April 2019, ARI hosted the first ever XR Midwest Conference.
